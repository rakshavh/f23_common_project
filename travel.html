            <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
            <p id="anchor2">Yellowstone is the first national park in the United States. It covers over 2.2 million acres, and provides an opportunity to see wildlife and explore geothermal areas.  In fact, Yellowstone contains about half the world's active geysers.</p>
            <p>These unique opportunities also bring out a lot of bad decisions among the tourists.  Every year visitors injure themselves or the wildlife by getting close to the animals.  You  can see examples of people making bad decisions by visiting <a href ="https://www.facebook.com/groups/yellowstonenationalparkinvasionoftheidiots/">Yellowstone National Park: Invasion of the Idiots</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/touronsofyellowstone/?hl=en">Tourons of Yellowstone</a>, or  <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/">Cowboy State Daily</a>.</p>

            <h3>Geographical Location: North America</h3>
            <p>Antelope Canyon, located in the heart of the American Southwest, is a mesmerizing slot canyon renowned for its ethereal beauty and unique geological formations. Carved over millions of years by the relentless forces of wind and water, this slot canyon is divided into two sections: <a href ="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Upper+Antelope+Canyon/@36.86175,-111.384592,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x873411f49b84300f:0x5d3f943dcf28fbcd!8m2!3d36.861751!4d-111.3742923!16s%2Fg%2F11bw4kws06!5m1!1e4?entry=ttu">Upper Antelope Canyon </a> and <a href ="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lower+Antelope+Canyon/@36.9031274,-111.4132505,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x87341390d062470d:0x1a93ee60f141ec14!8m2!3d36.9031279!4d-111.4132505!16s%2Fg%2F11b8y89fm7!5m1!1e4?entry=ttu">Lower Antelope Canyon</a>. Both sections offer visitors a surreal and otherworldly experience. The narrow sandstone walls of the canyon feature wave-like patterns, twisting passageways, and a play of light and shadow that creates an ever-changing and breathtaking visual spectacle.</p>
            <p>Upper Antelope Canyon is especially famous for its shafts of sunlight that penetrate the narrow openings above, casting vibrant beams of light onto the canyon floor. This phenomenon has earned it the nickname <a href ="http://www.riverlakes.com/corkscrewcanyon.htm">"The Corkscrew"</a> due to the twisting light beams. In contrast, Lower Antelope Canyon is characterized by its ladders and staircases that lead visitors through the narrower passages and offer a different perspective of the stunning rock formations.</p>
